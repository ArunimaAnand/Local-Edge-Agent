Chat Transcript — “Operation Banana Fog” — 04/04/2044

[09:13] Agent Marmalade: Status update: the experimental fog machine has begun generating banana-scented cumulonimbus clusters again. The squirrels are forming a council.
[09:14] Analyst NoodleHat: Confirmed. Satellite imagery shows at least nine squirrels wearing ceremonial capes. One has a clipboard. This seems bad.
[09:15] Agent Marmalade: The banana fog density is rising. Should I deploy the emergency potassium-reversal umbrella?
[09:16] Director GrapeBoss: Negative. Last time you opened that umbrella, the entire town spontaneously learned tap-dancing.
[09:17] Analyst NoodleHat: Correction: they learned competitive tap-dancing.
[09:18] Agent Marmalade: Understood. Initiating contingency protocol: Operation Unripe Avocado.
